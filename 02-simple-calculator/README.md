# 🧮 Simple Calculator in Python

This is a basic calculator built using Python. It allows the user to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can continue performing operations on the result until they choose to stop.

## 🚀 Features
- Handles `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operations
- Allows continuous calculations on the result
- Interactive console input and output
- Error message for unsupported operations

## 💻 How It Works
1. The user enters two numbers and an operator.
2. The calculator performs the selected operation and displays the result.
3. The user is then asked if they want to continue using the result in further calculations.
4. The process continues until the user inputs `'n'`.
